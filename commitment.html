      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At <strong>JustAI Jobs</strong>, our mission is to promote fairness, dignity, and opportunity in the growing field of ethical artificial intelligence. We are committed to fostering inclusive hiring practices that uplift underrepresented talent and empower purpose-driven employers.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a world where AI is not only powerful and intelligent, but also ethical, inclusive, and humane — built by diverse teams who are fairly hired, equitably compensated, and treated with respect. Through our platform, we aim to bridge opportunity gaps and promote decent work for all, in alignment with <strong>United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #8</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Our Promise</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We promote job listings from employers committed to fair and ethical hiring.</li>
        <li>We will never support discriminatory or exploitative job practices.</li>
        <li>We encourage employers to value skills, experience, and lived perspectives — not just credentials.</li>
        <li>We protect user data and respect the dignity of every applicant and employer who joins our platform.</li>
        <li>We actively encourage diversity, equity, and inclusion in every part of the hiring process.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Built on Trust and Integrity</h2>
      <p><strong>JustAI Jobs</strong> is a course project — but our commitment to ethics is real. We may not be a commercial job board, but we stand by the values we design into our platform. We believe fair hiring isn’t just a feature — it’s the foundation of a better AI future.</p>

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>We invite students, developers, researchers, and advocates to help us improve. Your feedback fuels this mission. Reach out via our <a href="support-inquiries.html">Support & Inquiries</a> page — we’d love to hear from you.</p>
