      <h2>JustAI Jobs: Connecting Ethical Talent with Purpose</h2>
      <p><strong>JustAI Jobs</strong> is a platform designed to connect job seekers and employers who are committed to ethical practices in the field of artificial intelligence. Our mission is simple: to create a space where AI work is not only innovative, but also fair, inclusive, and responsible.</p>

      <p>As part of an academic initiative, JustAI Jobs is built with the values of transparency, accountability, and opportunity at its core. We provide a marketplace where employers can post roles that reflect their ethical commitments, and job seekers can find meaningful work that aligns with their values.</p>

      <h2>Supporting Sustainable Development Goal #8</h2>
      <p>JustAI Jobs directly supports the United Nations <strong>SDG #8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</strong> by advocating for equitable job opportunities in one of the world’s most influential sectors—technology. We believe that as AI reshapes the global economy, it should also elevate standards for fair wages, safe working conditions, and equal access to opportunity.</p>

      <p>Through intentional design and thoughtful job curation, our platform encourages ethical hiring practices and helps users engage with work that promotes both professional growth and social impact. Whether you're a student, a technologist, or a hiring manager, JustAI Jobs is here to help you be part of a movement for responsible innovation and decent work for all.</p>
